### Webcomic Palette
The original webcomic palette was designed to make use of the limited supply of ink I was able to obtain do to lack of funds, when I wasn't using homemade ink. Homemade ink ia seperate color palette that will come up soon.

This functions as the base for the Neon Bassanova color palette.

### Fashion Palette
The fashion color palette is similar, except that it's built around matching colors with their respective complementary colors. So someone like Ehena-Marie would be wearing Fuschia if she went by what colors complemented her hair color.

For instance, if you have a darker hair color, you would wear red and baby blue. If you have a brighter hair color, you'd wear lime green or fuschia / steel pink.

### Homemade Ink
This is my homemade ink palette, which often gets confused for Dark Academia as well. But these one specifically revolves around murder, and more specifically mercy killing and angels of mercy, that murder their victims with Arsenic, and dress in Gunmetal Grey.

As a side note, gunmetal can also be a shade of Cyan blue as well, which I'll cover in the Vipers And Tigers palette.

### Tiger And Vipers Plaid
These are the plaid patterns that match with the Tigers and Vipers organized crime ring in my science fiction setting. Expanding on a special section for that palette.
