### Webcomic Palette
The original webcomic palette was designed to make use of the limited supply of ink I was able to obtain do to lack of funds, when I wasn't using homemade ink. Homemade ink ia seperate color palette that will come up soon.

This functions as the base for the Neon Bassanova color palette.

### Fashion Palette
The fashion color palette is similar, except that it's built around matching colors with their respective complementary colors. So someone like Ehena-Marie would be wearing Fuschia if she went by what colors complemented her hair color.

### Tiger And Vipers Plaid
These are the plaid patterns that match with the Tigers and Vipers organized crime ring in my science fiction setting.
