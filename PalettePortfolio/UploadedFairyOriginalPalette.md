title: "Uploaded Fairy Palette Original"

The original color palette I used for the storyboard version:

![Original Palette](https://github.com/LWFlouisa/PinPalette/blob/main/Images/panels/drawingtests/OriginalUploadedFairyPalette.png?raw=true)

Later evolution of the Uploaded Fairy Palette:

![Ehena-Marie](https://github.com/LWFlouisa/PinPalette/blob/main/Images/panels/drawingtests/LaterEvolution.png?raw=true)

This is what would eventually be fleshed out into "Neon Bassanova", a French alternative to Dark Academia:
