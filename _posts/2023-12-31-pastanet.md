Pastanet is an unofficial underground network of urban legends that spreads through dead drops in the city, that also go along with travel logs by weary travelers.

This phenominon was first noted, as a way for Vampire culture to communicate without directly facing each other to avoid unwanted attention when grave robbing. But over time became a sizeable portion of underground culture in general.

There are some creepypasta stories that are best conveyed in dead drops, rather than by the conventional internet, and can be distributed even in places like Cuba with limited access to information.
