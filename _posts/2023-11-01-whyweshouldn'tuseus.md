Imagine being an independant game design team of a Black Metalist, Goth Girl, and a Emo / Scene Girl, and your tasked with making:

-- A complete autobiographical band themed JRPG in three months.<br />
-- It must be a tactical turned based RPG like Final Fantasy tactics with dating SIM elements.<br />
-- A speed run is done in 25 minutes, but playable for up to 25 hours if you're a completionist.<br />
-- Customizeable by the user within the Black Metal, Goth, and Emo color palettes.<br />
-- That JRPG must be complete in three installments, and encompass the themes of a music video in each genre:<br />

Creating a complete autobiographical band-themed JRPG with tactical turn-based RPG elements and dating SIM elements, customizable within the Black Metal, Goth, and Emo color palettes, and divided into three installments, is a massive task. However, it's feasible with careful planning, execution, and collaboration. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you could approach this:

1. **Planning and Designing the Game:**

   Start by outlining the game's story, characters, and gameplay mechanics. Since you want to create a tactical turn-based RPG like Final Fantasy Tactics, you'll need to incorporate elements like a turn-based combat system, movement and positioning, and environmental and terrain effects [Source 1](https://turnbasedlovers.com/originals/best-20-tactical-strategy-turn-based-rpgs-of-the-last-two-years-up-to-2023/).

   You'll also want to incorporate dating SIM elements. While there aren't many games that combine these genres, you can take inspiration from games like Persona 5, which has a "Confidants" system that allows players to build relationships with characters [Source 7](https://www.thegamer.com/jrpg-turn-based-best-all-time-ranked/).

   For the band theme, you could create a unique mechanic where the player's actions and decisions affect the band's popularity and success. This could be tied into the game's story and progression.

2. **Development:**

   Use a game development engine that supports the creation of 2D games. Godot is a popular choice among indie developers due to its flexibility and ease of use [Source 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/blygzd/is_there_a_good_tutorial_for_making_turn_based/).

   Start by developing the core gameplay mechanics. This includes the turn-based combat system, character and enemy movement, and the dating SIM elements. You can use existing games as a reference for these mechanics. For instance, you can look at games like Wasteland 3, Wildermyth, and Triangle Strategy for tactical RPG elements [Source 1](https://turnbasedlovers.com/originals/best-20-tactical-strategy-turn-based-rpgs-of-the-last-two-years-up-to-2023/).

   For the dating SIM elements, you can draw inspiration from Persona 5's "Confidants" system [Source 7](https://www.thegamer.com/jrpg-turn-based-best-all-time-ranked/).

3. **Customization:**

   Allow players to customize their characters within the Black Metal, Goth, and Emo color palettes. This can be done by providing different outfit options for characters and allowing players to change their color schemes.

4. **Release and Iteration:**

   Plan to release the game in three installments. Each installment should tell a part of the overall story and include new content like new characters, locations, and gameplay features.

   After each installment, gather feedback from players and make necessary adjustments to improve the game. This could include balancing the game's difficulty, fixing bugs, or adding new features based on player suggestions.

5. **Speedrun and Completionist Gameplay:**

   To ensure the game is playable in 25 minutes for a speedrun and up to 25 hours for a completionist, you'll need to carefully balance the game's difficulty and pacing. This includes the combat system, resource management, and the speed at which players can progress through the game.

   You can use speedrunning guides and forums as a reference for what aspects of the game need to be sped up or slowed down.

Remember, creating a game is a massive undertaking that requires a lot of time, effort, and dedication. But with careful planning and execution, it's definitely achievable. Good luck!
