This panel is about 333 by 202 pixels. Four of these make a basic custom 4 Koma layout. I use this to create graphics novels as a series of 1-4 panel comic strips. But now that I'm drawing digitally, I could also use this method for storyboarding.

Although I still would prefer traditional for storyboarding graphic novels.
