In practice with Neon Bassanova, you don't actually use all of the colors available, but use mostly a monochrome palette, and then pick certain primary highlights and mixed highlights to emphasis certain person, places, and things in a webcomic.

For example, these are for part two, where I need lime or red to emphasis certain persons, places, and things.
